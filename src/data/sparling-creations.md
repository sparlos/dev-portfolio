A [website](http://sparlingcreations.com/) built to house my freelance web design, video and audio projects. The site is powered by Vue and uses Vue Router for navigation.

The design was created completely from scratch in Adobe XD, with animations and transitions all hand-coded using SCSS and BEM methodology. I wrote a mini-app in Vue that wraps the SoundCloud iFrame API in the ‘Music’ section of the site. This was done for aesthetic reasons in order to make the design of the player compliment the design of the site. The data layer of the site is powered using [Cockpit CMS](https://getcockpit.com/) allowing for easy addition of new projects.
