[A website](https://studio-planner.vercel.app/) created to showcase a simple authenticated app that allows users to sign up/log in, and then access an instrument dashboard. This dashboard allows a user to view, create and delete instruments. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to power the front end, with the backend and database layers handled by [Supbase.io](https://supabase.io/).

I usually do styling from the ground up using SCSS, but as the purpose of this project was to display my fullstack abilities, I opted to use [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) to rapidly build out the front end (and because I've been dying to play around with it). The dashboard allows drag and drop functionality, which is powered by [dnd kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/).
