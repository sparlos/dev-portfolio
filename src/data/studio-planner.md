[A website](studio-planner.vercel.app) created to showcase a simple authenticated app that allows users to sign up/log in, and then access an instrument dashboard which allows them to view, create and delete instruments. It uses Next.js to power the front end, with the backend and database layers handled by [Supbase.io](https://docs.dndkit.com/).

I usually do styling from the ground up using SCSS, but as the purpose of this project was to display my fullstack abilities, I opted to use Chakra UI to rapidly build out the front end. The dashboard allows drag and drop functionality powered by [dnd kit](https://docs.dndkit.com/).
